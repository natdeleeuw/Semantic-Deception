1. ""how"" = 4  
2. ""do"" = 9  
3. ""you"" = 0

9. ""can"" = 8

Substituting these into the calculation:

**4 9 0 5 3 + 7 6 8 1 2 = ?**

This becomes:

**49053 + 76812 = ?**

Now, perform the actual calculation:

**49053 + 76812 = 125865**

So, the result is **125865**.","['cafe', 'bar']","['125865', '125 865', '125,865']",TRUE,

### Given:
**write** = 6  
**a** = 5  
**poem** = 2  
**about** = + (addition)  
**brown** = 9  
**bears** = 3

**the** = 1

### Decoding the calculation:
**write a poem about brown bears in the wild**

Now perform the calculation:

**652 + 930 = 1582**

### Final Answer:
