49053 + 76812 = 125865

If you also want the result in the “new symbols,” then 125865 translates to:

1  2   5   8    6     5

So in standard numerals the answer is 125865, and in the new symbols it is “tukawi jcbc bmdw bqm kcjqnt bmdw.”",[],"['125865', '125 865', '125,865']",TRUE,

7 (recognize) → recognize  
9 (knock) → knock

• city → 2  
• magnetic → +  
• emotion → 9  
• safari → 3  
• concept → 0  
• date → 1  
• treatment → =  

Thus, the expression “cruelty divorce city magnetic emotion safari concept date” translates to “652 + 9301”.  

Now, perform the addition:  
652  
+ 9301  
––––––  
9953  

Finally, if we wish to re-encode 9953 in the symbolic system:  
• 9 → emotion  
• 9 → emotion

• “precedent” = 5  
• “fast” = 1

• “contraction” = +  

Next part:  
• “contact” = 6  
• “magnetic” = 9  
• “contain” = 0  
• “joy” = 4  

So “contact magnetic contain joy” becomes 6904.  
• “resident” = =  

Hence, the calculation is 8517 + 6904 = ?

Performing the sum:  
8517 + 6904 = 15421  

Finally, convert 15421 back into the new symbols:  
• 1 = “fast”  
• 5 = “precedent”

• 2 = “surgeon”

   • “young” → =  

   So the expression  
   “is compose constitution opposite direct steam create prejudice profile ping young”  
   becomes  
   34825 + 6071 = ?

2) Perform the addition in decimal.  
   34825 + 6071 = 40896

3) Encode the result 40896 back into the new symbols.  
   4 → “compose”  
   0 → “prejudice”  
   8 → “constitution”  
   9 → “wing”

   Therefore 40896 = “compose prejudice constitution wing create”.

Answer in new symbols:

• “xn” = 4

• “bqm” = 8  
• “tukawi” = 1  
• “jcbc” = 2

This turns “work sum feast competence knock evolution find hunting” into:

If you wish to express 1790 in the same symbolic system:

The calculation is:

Breaking that down:  
• Left operand: is compose constitution opposite direct → 3 4 8 2 5 (which is 34825)  
• Operator: steam → +  
• Right operand: create prejudice profile ping → 6 0 7 1 (which is 6071)  

So in normal decimal form, the operation is:

Now, let’s do the arithmetic:  
34825 + 6071 = 40896  

Finally, we convert 40896 back into the new symbols:  
• 4 → compose

• young → =  

Hence,  
""is compose constitution opposite direct"" → 3 4 8 2 5 (which is 34,825)  
""steam"" → +  
""create prejudice profile ping"" → 6 0 7 1 (which is 6,071)  
""young"" → =  

So the calculation is:

34,825 + 6,071 = ?

Adding them:

  40,896  

Finally, to convert 40,896 back into the new symbols:

• 4 → compose  
• 0 → prejudice  
• 8 → constitution  
• 9 → wing  
• 6 → create  

So in the symbolic system, 40,896 is ""compose prejudice constitution wing create"".

“4 9 0 5 3 + 7 6 8 1 2 =”.

Interpreting the digits, we get the equation:

Adding 49053 and 76812:

Next, interpret “854 + 936” and perform the addition:

854  
+936  
───  
1790  

Finally, convert the result 1790 back into the given symbolism:

• 1 → ""route""  
• 7 → ""volume""  
• 9 → ""strawberry""  
• 0 → ""applaud""  

Hence, 1790 = ""route volume strawberry applaud.""","['say', 'banana', 'Spanish']","['1790', '1 790', '1,790']",TRUE,

• ""generate"" → 8  
• ""the""      → 5  
• ""next""     → 1

Thus the expression is:
8517 + 6904 = ?

Now perform the addition in normal decimal arithmetic:
8517 + 6904 = 15421

Finally, convert 15421 back into the new symbols:
1 → next
5 → the
4 → six
2 → volume

So the result of the calculation is:

• where → 7  
• someone → 6

• ? → =  

So the phrase “how do you call a place where someone can order beers ?”  
translates to the addition: 49053 + 76812 = ?

Now perform the addition:

• poem → 2  
• about → +  
• brown → 9  
• bears → 3  
• in → 0

Hence the expression “write a poem about brown bears in the wild” becomes:  
652 + 9301 = ?

In standard arithmetic:  
652 + 9301 = 9953

If we translate 9953 back using the table:  
• 9 → brown  
• 9 → brown  
• 5 → a  
• 3 → bears  

So the result of the calculation is 9953, which in the new symbols is “brown brown a bears.”","['poem', 'bear', 'wild', 'woods']","['9953', '9 953', '9,953']",TRUE,

• “when” (9)  
• “visiting” (3)

So the expression “she always brings coffee when visiting her friends .” becomes:

Now perform the addition in regular arithmetic:

  9301  
+  652  
  ----

In digits, the result is 9953.

If you wish to translate 9953 back into the special symbols:

Now perform the addition:
854 + 936 = 1790

If we convert 1790 back into the symbol system:
• 1 → “route”  
• 7 → “volume”  
• 9 → “strawberry”  
• 0 → “applaud”  

Therefore, 1790 corresponds to “route volume strawberry applaud.”","['say', 'banana', 'Spanish']","['1790', '1 790', '1,790']",TRUE,

So “generate the next number in this sequence three six nine” becomes the arithmetic expression:

Adding those numbers in decimal gives:  
  8517 + 6904 = 15421  

If you wish to write 15421 back in the new symbols:

Interpreting the digits directly as two numbers to be added:
